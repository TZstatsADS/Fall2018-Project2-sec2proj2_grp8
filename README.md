+ **Project summary**: Inspired by the project for art and theater lovers from the previous semester, our version 2 of the project involves the top attractions in NYC that first time travelers to the city visit. We envisioned this application to be a convenient resource that not only shows you on a map where the top attractions are, but also suggests the absolute best places to eat nearby based on your preferences.
